# Impermax-Supply-Scraper

An extremely slow and inefficient scraper that pulls Impermax Supply APR, Borrow APR, and user Supply positions from any and all Impermax deployment via web3 calls. Prints current position to the console due to the extremely long runtime (which is also printed at the end, and, depending on the chain and number of pairs, up to 15 minutes). Can be easily forked to include Impermax forks. 

# Usage: 
get_info("Polygon", recipient)
